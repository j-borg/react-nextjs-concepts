## React & Next.js concepts

This project showcases best practices, conventions, and tooling, and is not intended to function as a real application.

### Code Quality

The following tools are used to ensure code quality:

1. Chromatic
2. ESlint
3. Husky
4. Jest
5. Prettier
6. Sentry
7. Stylelint

### Project structure

This project demonstrates how a Next.js application can be structured by dividing it into a generic Foundation layer and a specific Domain layer.

### Model-View-Presenter

This project illustrates how to implement the MVP pattern in a Next.js application using TanStack Query. The Model manages data (both client-side and server-side state), the Presenter coordinates updates and events, and the View handles presentation logic.

### Tests

This project provides examples of testing React components, React hooks, and Tanstack Query hooks using Jest.
